              A while back while looking for some online help for a git problem I was having I came
              across a site created by Seth Robertson titled "
              <a href="https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html" target="_blank">
                On undoing, fixing, or removing commits in git
              </a>
              " and I really loved the completeness of his work, but I thought, "If this is going to
              be a pick your own adventure style website what if it was shown in smaller bite-sized
              pages?" So I created this site. The content is all Seth Robertson's and he should
              absolutely get all the credit he deserves for it. Many of the links even go to his{' '}
              <a href="https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/" target="_blank">
                Git Best Practices
              </a>{' '}
              companion site and his{' '}

                Post-Production Editing using Git

              site.
