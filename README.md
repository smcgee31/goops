# Goops!

##### (git oops!)

This content for this project was shamelessly lifted from [this site](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html) and all content credit goes to Seth Robertson. I simply wanted to take what he'd done and make the process of using it a little more easier to read by being a little more bite-sized.

## Development

This repo is a React + TypeScript + Vite project.
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a super fast dev server that you can learn more about [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

To get started, clone the repo and run `npm i` to install dependencies. Then run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
