                best practice
              </a>{' '}
              is for you to stash the changes in case you were mistaken and later decide that you
              really wanted them after all.{' '}
              <InlineCode>git stash save "description of changes"</InlineCode>. You can revisit
              those stashes later <InlineCode>git stash list</InlineCode> and decide whether to{' '}
              <InlineCode>git stash drop</InlineCode> them after some time has past. Please note
              that untracked and ignored files are not stashed by default. See "--include-untracked"
              and "--all" for stash options to handle those two cases.

              However, perhaps you are confident (or arrogant) enough to know for sure that you will
              never ever want the uncommitted changes. If so, you can run{' '}
              <InlineCode>git reset --hard</InlineCode>, however please be quite aware that this is
              almost certainly a completely unrecoverable operation. Any changes which are removed
              here cannot be restored later. This will not delete untracked or ignored files. Those
              can be deleted with <InlineCode>git clean -nd</InlineCode>{' '}
              <InlineCode>git clean -ndX</InlineCode> respectively, or{' '}
              <InlineCode>git clean -ndx</InlineCode> for both at once. Well, actually those command
              do not delete the files. They show what files will be deleted. Replace the "n" in
              "-ndâ€¦" with "f" to actually delete the files. Best practice is to ensure you are not
              deleting what you should not by looking at the moribund filenames first.
